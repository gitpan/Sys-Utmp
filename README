README FOR Sys::Utmp

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

The module requires that your system's C libraries export the functions
getutent(), setutent() and endutent() - if make complains that it can't find
these functions and you know that they exist then you may have to supply the
LIBS directive to Makefile.PL to include the appropriate library:

   perl Makefile.PL LIBS='-lc'

for example.

The module will not build on systems (such as BSD) that do not have these 
functions (although the author could be persuaded to provide support for
these if there is demand.)
